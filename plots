A computer program to solve the set of equations and obtain a solution. 
For each case, the initial field is set to be zero. Integration in time 
is done till a steady state solution is reached. At each time step the 
pressure equation average 𝐿2 norm should be converged to a
residue of at least 10−5. Specify what solver you use for the pressure equation. Steady
state can be assumed when the average 𝐿2 norm of the change in x- and y-velocities of
the interior nodes between two time steps is less than 10−8.

Simulations are ran for the following cases:

Re=100
N=32x32 dt=3.125e-3, 6.23e-3, 0.0125
N=64x64 dt=5e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3
N=128x128 dt=1.25e-4, 2.5e-4, 5e-4

Re=1000
N=32x32 dt=3.125e-3

Plot the 𝐿2 norm of the change in solution (u-velocity) versus the non-dimensional time
units on a semi-log plot to show convergence to steady state. Comment on the trends.
Compare (plot) the u-velocity distribution at x=0.5 and the v-velocity distribution at
y=0.5 with the data given in Tables I and II in the paper for all three grids on the same
plot using one representative time step. Comment on the trends.
Also plot the CPU time for convergence to steady state versus the grid resolution for all
time steps. Comment on the trends
